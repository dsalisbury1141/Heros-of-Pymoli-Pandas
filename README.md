# Heros-of-Pymoli using Python Pandas

Observations:
1. There were multiple purchases by the same screen names
2. Most purchases (44%) were made by age group 20-24
3. The least purchases were made by age group over 40 


Additional Observations: 
I found it most difficult to pull the data based on with duplicates 
and without duplicates based on the required outcome. 
I learned a lot during this exercise, and found it very challenging.
